# ObjectDetection

I created this repo for keeping scripts I played or experimented.</br>
Most of code are kept in ".ipynb" to show how each line of code works.</br>
</br>
## Codes adapted from
 <li> https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/</li>
 <li> https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/</li>
 <li> Class material of Image Analytics and Computer Vision By Asst.Prof.Thitirat Siriborvornratanakul, Ph.D.</li>
</br>
</br>
## list of topics in this repo are list below </br>
<li> CountObjectInImage.ipynb : Object detection with counting frequency of object </li>
